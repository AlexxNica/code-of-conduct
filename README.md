Welcome to [Hackathon Hackers](http://hh.gd)! This group is of, by, and for people who love hackathons—whether you attend hackathons, run them, critique them and the industrial-capitalist system that manifests itself around them, or just love to hack, this group is for you. We're glad you're here.

This document is both an introduction to Hackathon Hackers (HH) and a reference of the rules, guidelines, and code of conduct we've set up to make HH a place for everyone to feel welcome. They also apply to all HH subgroups, although subgroups may also extend these to better serve their own community.

## About Hackathon Hackers

Hackathon Hackers is an online space for hackers across the globe to connect and spread the hackathon spirit. Members are aged from middle school to retirement, span across most gender identities and races, and hail from six of the seven continents. They’re united by the common love of creating amazing things with technology, usually over the course of a weekend at some college's hackathon. If this sounds like you, [come join us](http://hh.gd)!

## Laws of Robotics

There are certain commands moderators can enter as comments to manage threads. Presently these include:

* `/thread` — This is our way of locking threads. From there on out, only moderators can post.
* `/slow` — Only one post per minute per user on the thread is allowed.
* `/ama $AMAer` — Our way of hosting Ask Me Anything's. Only the person doing the AMA will be able post on that thread. A separate thread will exist for questions, keeping the AMA answers tidy.

These commands are implemented through [Hackbot](http://hh.gd/hackbot), an extensible Facebook Group automoderator. We are looking to expand on these in the future.

## Rules and Guidelines

Hackers are diverse and complex, with many different interests and passions. These rules are in place so that everyone can feel comfortable participating in HH. If you think they need editing or don't cover something important, please send a pull request to start the discussion.

While the rest of this section will go into detail about what is and isn't acceptable, our guiding principle can be summarized in one 90's-era sentence: *"Be excellent to each other."*

* TODO: Fill in the rest of the rules from the etiquette document.

## FAQs

> What should I do if I see someone violating the Code of Conduct?

There's an option to report a thread if you click on the arrow in its top right hand corner. Then, a mod will look into it and take action. If the problem isn't specific to a thread, reach out to one of the [HH moderators](#moderators) directly.

> Why is this moderator ignoring me?

Moderators are volunteers with busy lives outside of HH. They will usually reply to you very promptly or connect you with someone who can, but if a moderator is taking longer to get back to you than you would like, please be patient. 

> What if I disagree with the moderator who reached out to me?

Feel free to reach out to other moderators, but all mods use the same CoC so I would not expect different results.

> Can I contribute and improve this code of conduct?

Contributions are welcome on how to improve this code of conduct! Send us a pull request with your suggestions.

> Doesn't this impact the right to free speech? Why are you stomping on my rights?
