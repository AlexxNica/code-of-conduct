Welcome to [Hackathon Hackers](http://hh.gd)! 

Hackathon Hackers is a community. Whenever you post or reply, there are other people sitting behind the screen reading what you say. These other people have thoughts, ideas, dreams, aspirations, troubles, advice, perspectives, feelings, and experiences, just like you. You'll probably end up meeting a lot of them if you go to hackathons. Everyone in this group is a potential new friend—treat them that way.

If you want to recruit us, [please post here](hh.gd/jobs). If you post job listings anywhere else, we will ban you forever.

They also apply to all [HH subgroups](https://github.com/HackathonHackers/groups), although subgroups may extend these to better serve their own community.

## About Hackathon Hackers

Hackathon Hackers is a space where people learn together. 

Members are aged from middle school to retirement, span across most gender identities and races, and hail from six of the seven continents. They’re united by the common love of creating amazing things with technology, usually over the course of a weekend at college hackathons. If you want to create things, come join us!

#### Bird's-eye View

Hackathon Hackers is composed of a loosely-connected ecosystem of Facebook Groups. The [main group of Hackathon Hackers](http://hh.gd) is the largest and most active. It's a catch-all for discussions about anything hackers care about. Think of it more as 'HH General' or  `#general` on Slack.

There are over 50 topic-based subgroups of Hackathon Hackers. Each is managed by an independent team of volunteer moderators and must abide by this code of conduct. You can recognize them by the `HH` prefix in the group's name. Can't find the subgroup you're looking for or don't like what you find?

## Rules and Guidelines

Hackers are diverse and complex, with many different interests and passions. These rules are in place so that everyone can feel comfortable participating in HH. If you think they need editing or don't cover something important, please [send a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to start the discussion.

Our guiding principle can be summarized in one 90's-era sentence: *"Be excellent to each other."*

### Da Rules

These are hard-and-fast rules, and the only rules starting with "do not." Breaking any of these will result in your prompt removal from HH.

* **Do not** post peoples' personal information. This includes (but isn't limited to) private messages from people, home and work addresses, or private phone numbers.
* **Do not** post anything racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic, transphobic, or in any other way demeaning toward anyone. No [harassment](#appendix-a-definitions) of any kind. No exceptions.
* **Do not** make personal attacks or be intentionally rude. "That is an idiotic thing to say; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3." can be shortened to "1 + 1 is 2, not 3." 
* **Do not** spam. If Gmail wouldn't put it in my inbox, it shouldn't be in HH. 
* **Do not** recruit for your startup, company, job, or organization. Post in [HH Job Listings](http://hh.gd/jobs) instead.


### Guidelines

#### #1: There is no True Hacker.

*  The only requirement for being a hacker is curiosity. A person who doesn’t use Firefox, doesn’t like vim, loves Windows, studies the liberal arts, or has never written a line of code in their life is every bit as much a hackathon hacker as anyone else.
*  * Shutting down people with opposing viewpoints or making them feel bad is inneffective and unwelcome. If you need more clarification, read ["How to Disagree"](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html) by Paul Graham.

#### #2: Aim to educate.
* If you are offended by someone’s post, always be kind in explaining why. If you don’t feel able to respond to an offense in that manner, report the post and message the moderators.
* If someone is offended by your post, apologize, explain what you did mean, and ask how to improve. At the end of the day, be okay with agreeing to disagree. The last word rarely leaves a pleasant taste in the mouth.
* If you feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed with responses and want to just walk away, just leave a comment saying so. Respect people's decision to walk away and don’t tag them in your comments or pressure them to respond. 
* As a general discussion rule: when you can, please do take the time to educate your fellow hackers, for the betterment of the community. 

#### #3: Cooperate.

* Avoid excessive vulgarity and insults.
* Be open and encouraging. Inside jokes and knee-jerk responses (“LOL PHP”) can be fun in our personal lives, but in large groups, they tend to just leave people out or make them feel bad.
When you post, look for ways to empower the disempowered, break down stereotypes, and otherwise encourage everyone in the Hackathon Hackers community to enjoy hackathons and hacker culture.
* [Include everyone.](#inclusivity-statement) For example, ask about the most influential leaders in tech instead of the most influential guys in tech.
* If you must criticize, keep it constructive. It is far, far easier to tear something down than to build something up, and this is a community all about building. We should encourage people to create as much as possible.

#### #4: Get involved.

* “Lurking” is a totally valid way to belong, and attending gatherings is never required, but know that your participation is one hundred percent welcome, anytime.
* A good way to get involved is to start a thread about something you’re interested in. Chances are, with this many people in the group, someone else is bound to be excited to talk about your favorite library/program/website/language. Jump in!
* Advertising your personal projects is totally allowed, as long as it’s not of a spam-like nature. For example, posting an app or website you made, a club you’re involved with, or a cause you’re fighting for is awesome, creative, and exciting. Bumping it constantly or reposting it daily is inappropriate. If you want to give people work-in-progress updates, check out [HH What Are You Working On?](http://hh.gd/waywo)

## Inclusivity Statement

**Hackathon Hackers is the all-inclusive hackathons group.**

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. 

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.

**Our community prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:**

* 'Reverse'-isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia'
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you"
* Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts
* Communicating in a 'tone' you don’t find congenial
* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Laws of Robotics

There are certain commands moderators can enter as comments to manage threads. Presently these include:

* `/thread` — This is our way of locking threads. From there on out, only moderators can post.
* `/slow` — Only one post per minute per user on the thread is allowed.
* `/ama $AMAer` — Our way of hosting Ask Me Anything's. Only the person doing the AMA will be able post on that thread. A separate thread will exist for questions, keeping the AMA answers tidy.

These commands are implemented through [Hackbot](http://hh.gd/hackbot), an extensible Facebook Group automoderator. We are looking to expand on these in the future. Please contribute.

## FAQs

> What should I do if I see someone violating the Code of Conduct?

[Report the post](https://www.facebook.com/help/436113899837980) -- there's an option to report a thread if you click on the arrow in its top right hand corner. Then, a mod will look into it and take action. If the problem isn't specific to a thread, reach out to one of the [HH moderators](#moderators) directly.

> Why is this moderator ignoring me?

Moderators are volunteers with busy lives outside of HH. They will usually reply to you very promptly or connect you with someone who can, but if a moderator is taking longer to get back to you than you would like, please be patient. 

> What if I disagree with the moderator who reached out to me?

Feel free to reach out to other moderators, but all mods use the same CoC so I would not expect different results.

> Can I contribute and improve this code of conduct?

Contributions are welcome on how to improve this code of conduct! Send us a pull request with your suggestions.

> Doesn't this impact the right to free speech?

[Nope.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png)

## Appendix C: Starting a Subgroup

Anyone can start an HH subgroup. To begin, create a Facebook group whose name begins with `HH`, add a description/cover photo, and invite your friends. Once you've satisfied one of the prerequisites below, complete the [subgroup application form](http://hh.gd/subapp). A [moderator](#moderators) will review it within a few days. If your subgroup is made official, its name and short URL will be added to the main group's sidebar.

Any topic for a subgroup is acceptable as long as it provides value to the HH community. Many subgroups overlap with each other, so do not be afraid to submit applications for groups which might appear to be redundant.

##### Subgroups must satisfy one of these requirements:

* 1 week old, 5 posts, and 250 members
* 3 weeks old, 10 posts, and 100 members

##### Tips for creating subgroups

* Choose a short, descriptive name and a good cover photo.
* Invite your friends who are interested in the subgroup's topic. Ask them to post or comment in the group.
* Seed the subgroup with quality content so others know what to post.
* Make sure there is a diversity of posters early on. Subgroups are communities, not one-person-shows.
* Don't be afraid to fail or have your subgroup's topic overlap with other subgroups.

## Appendix D: Coda

Here’s to the hackers. The tinkerers. The makers. The ones who create things quickly. While some may see them as sleep-deprived loons, we see dedication. Because the students who are crazy enough to think they can make something awesome in just 36 hours, are the ones who do.
