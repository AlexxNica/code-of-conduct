Welcome to [Hackathon Hackers](http://hh.gd)! This group is of, by, and for people who love hackathons—whether you attend hackathons, run them, critique them and the industrial-capitalist system that manifests itself around them, or just love to hack, this group is for you. We're glad you're here.

This document is both an introduction to Hackathon Hackers (HH) and a reference of the rules, guidelines, and code of conduct we've set up to make HH a place for everyone to feel welcome. They also apply to all HH subgroups, although subgroups may also extend these to better serve their own community.

## About Hackathon Hackers

Hackathon Hackers is an online space for hackers across the globe to connect and spread the hackathon spirit. Members are aged from middle school to retirement, span across most gender identities and races, and hail from six of the seven continents. They’re united by the common love of creating amazing things with technology, usually over the course of a weekend at some college's hackathon. If this sounds like you, [come join us](http://hh.gd)!

## Rules and Guidelines

Hackers are diverse and complex, with many different interests and passions. These rules are in place so that everyone can feel comfortable participating in HH. If you think they need editing or don't cover something important, please send a pull request to start the discussion.

While the rest of this section will go into detail about what is and isn't acceptable, our guiding principle can be summarized in one 90's-era sentence: *"Be excellent to each other."*

* TODO: Fill in the rest of the rules from the etiquette document.
