Welcome to [Hackathon Hackers](http://hh.gd)! This group is of, by, and for people who love hackathons—whether you attend hackathons, run them, critique them and the industrial-capitalist system that manifests itself around them, or just love to hack, this group is for you. We're glad you're here.

This document is both an introduction to Hackathon Hackers (HH) and a reference of the rules, guidelines, and code of conduct we've set up to make HH a place for everyone to feel welcome. They also apply to all HH subgroups, although subgroups may also extend these to better serve their own community.

## About Hackathon Hackers

Hackathon Hackers is an online space for hackers across the globe to connect and spread the hackathon spirit. Members are aged from middle school to retirement, span across most gender identities and races, and hail from six of the seven continents. They’re united by the common love of creating amazing things with technology, usually over the course of a weekend at some college's hackathon. If this sounds like you, [come join us](http://hh.gd)!

## Rules and Guidelines

Hackers are diverse and complex, with many different interests and passions. These rules are in place so that everyone can feel comfortable participating in HH. If you think they need editing or don't cover something important, please send a pull request to start the discussion.

While the rest of this section will go into detail about what is and isn't acceptable, our guiding principle can be summarized in one 90's-era sentence: *"Be excellent to each other."*

* **Do not** post anything racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic, transphobic, or in any other way demeaning toward anyone. No [harassment](#appendix-a-definitions) of any kind. No exceptions.
* **Do not** make personal attacks or be intentionally rude. When disagreeing, keep your post about the topic. e.g. "That is an idiotic thing to say; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3." can be shortened to "1 + 1 is 2, not 3." and "This post is stupid." can be shortened to nothing at all.
* **Do not** spam. If Gmail wouldn't put it in my inbox, it shouldn't be in HH. This includes doing attention-catching things like writing in all caps, using linkbait headlines, or otherwise editing the post or preview to pop out at the cost of other posts.
* **Do not** recruit for your startup, company, job, or organization. Consider posting in HH Job Listings instead.
* **Do not** post peoples' personal information. This includes (but isn't limited to) private messages from people, home and work addresses, or private phone numbers.

## Inclusivity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.

**Our community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:**

* 'Reverse'-isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia'
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you"
* Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts
* Communicating in a 'tone' you don’t find congenial
* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Laws of Robotics

There are certain commands moderators can enter as comments to manage threads. Presently these include:

* `/thread` — This is our way of locking threads. From there on out, only moderators can post.
* `/slow` — Only one post per minute per user on the thread is allowed.
* `/ama $AMAer` — Our way of hosting Ask Me Anything's. Only the person doing the AMA will be able post on that thread. A separate thread will exist for questions, keeping the AMA answers tidy.

These commands are implemented through [Hackbot](http://hh.gd/hackbot), an extensible Facebook Group automoderator. We are looking to expand on these in the future.

## FAQs

> What should I do if I see someone violating the Code of Conduct?

There's an option to report a thread if you click on the arrow in its top right hand corner. Then, a mod will look into it and take action. If the problem isn't specific to a thread, reach out to one of the [HH moderators](#moderators) directly.

> Why is this moderator ignoring me?

Moderators are volunteers with busy lives outside of HH. They will usually reply to you very promptly or connect you with someone who can, but if a moderator is taking longer to get back to you than you would like, please be patient. 

> What if I disagree with the moderator who reached out to me?

Feel free to reach out to other moderators, but all mods use the same CoC so I would not expect different results.

> Can I contribute and improve this code of conduct?

Contributions are welcome on how to improve this code of conduct! Send us a pull request with your suggestions.

> Doesn't this impact the right to free speech?

[Nope.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png)
