Welcome to [Hackathon Hackers](http://hh.gd)! This group is of, by, and for people who love hackathons—whether you attend hackathons, run them, critique them and the industrial-capitalist system that manifests itself around them, or just love to hack, this group is for you. We're glad you're here.

This document is both an introduction to Hackathon Hackers (HH) and a reference of the rules, guidelines, and code of conduct we've set up to make HH a place for everyone to feel welcome. They also apply to all HH subgroups, although subgroups may also extend these to better serve their own community.

## About Hackathon Hackers

Hackathon Hackers is an online space for hackers across the globe to connect and spread the hackathon spirit. Members are aged from middle school to retirement, span across most gender identities and races, and hail from six of the seven continents. They’re united by the common love of creating amazing things with technology, usually over the course of a weekend at some college's hackathon. If this sounds like you, come join us!

Hackathon Hackers is composed of a number of loosely-connected ecosystem of Facebook Groups. The [main group of Hackathon Hackers](http://hh.gd) is the largest and most active. It's a catch-all for discussions about anything related to hackathons, however indirectly. Think of it like `#general` on Slack.

There are over 50 subgroups of Hackathon Hackers. Each is a topic-based subcommunity focusing on specific technologies, regions, or events. Each is managed by an independent team of volunteer moderators and must abide by this code of conduct. The list of official subgroups is located in the sidebar of the main group. You can recognize them by the `HH` prefix in the group's name.

#### Starting a Subgroup

Anyone can start an HH subgroup. To begin, create a Facebook group whose name begins with `HH`, add a description/cover photo, and invite your friends. Once you've satisfied one of the prerequisites below, complete the [subgroup application form](http://hh.gd/subapp). A [moderator](#moderators) will review it within a few days. If your subgroup is made official, its name and short URL will be added to the main group's sidebar.

Any topic for a subgroup is acceptable as long as it provides value to the HH community. Many subgroups overlap with each other, so do not be afraid to submit applications for groups which might appear to be redundant.

**Subgroups must satisfy one of these requirements:**

* 1 week old, 5 posts, and 250 members
* 3 weeks old, 10 posts, and 100 members

## Rules and Guidelines

Hackers are diverse and complex, with many different interests and passions. These rules are in place so that everyone can feel comfortable participating in HH. If you think they need editing or don't cover something important, please send a pull request to start the discussion.

While the rest of this section will go into detail about what is and isn't acceptable, our guiding principle can be summarized in one 90's-era sentence: *"Be excellent to each other."*

### Da Rules

These are hard-and-fast rules, and the only rules starting with "do not." Please follow them. Breaking any of these will result in your post being removed, a moderator contacting you, and you may potentially be removed from HH.

* **Do not** post anything racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic, transphobic, or in any other way demeaning toward anyone. No [harassment](#appendix-a-definitions) of any kind. No exceptions.
* **Do not** make personal attacks or be intentionally rude. When disagreeing, keep your post about the topic. e.g. "That is an idiotic thing to say; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3." can be shortened to "1 + 1 is 2, not 3." and "This post is stupid." can be shortened to nothing at all.
* **Do not** spam. If Gmail wouldn't put it in my inbox, it shouldn't be in HH. This includes doing attention-catching things like writing in all caps, using linkbait headlines, or otherwise editing the post or preview to pop out at the cost of other posts.
* **Do not** recruit for your startup, company, job, or organization. Consider posting in [HH Job Listings](http://hh.gd/jobs) instead.
* **Do not** post requests or giveaways for free stuff/invites. Those belong in [HH Free Stuff](http://hh.gd/freestuff).
* **Do not** post peoples' personal information. This includes (but isn't limited to) private messages from people, home and work addresses, or private phone numbers.

### Guidelines

Hackathon Hackers is a community. Whenever you post or reply, there are other people sitting behind the screen reading what you say. These other people have thoughts, ideas, dreams, aspirations, troubles, advice, perspectives, feelings, and experiences, just like you. You'll probably end up meeting a lot of them if you go to hackathons. Everyone in this group is a potential new friend—treat them that way.

These guidelines are just that: guidelines. They're not all-encompassing but they're here to show what kind of behavior and mindset we expect from HH'ers.

#### #1: People are complex, and so are ideas.

* There is no True Hacker. That is, a person who doesn’t use Firefox, doesn’t like vim, loves Windows, studies the liberal arts, or has never written a line of code in their life is every bit as much a hackathon hacker as anyone else. The only requirement for being a hacker is curiosity.
* We’re a very enthusiastic bunch, and sometimes we just want to share our excitement (or rant) about something without fearing a conflict, so don’t derail or instigate an argument on someone else’s post if they haven’t expressed their willingness to debate. If you want, you can make your own post and invite input from everyone without infringing on someone else’s space.
* In discussions with multiple conflicting points of view, the goal for all sides should always be information and education, not shutting down people with opposing viewpoints or making them feel bad. Remain calm and remember that the truth resists simplicity—don’t polarize the discussion, use straw-man arguments, or attack individual participants.
* HH is an open forum and a welcoming space. In controversial conversations, members have often felt afraid to chime in for fear of offending. A simple solution? Disclaimers. Prefacing your comment with a “I’m new to <topic> and I do not mean this maliciously at all, so I apologize in advance if this is harmful and I am open to correction but here’s my unedited opinion” can be a wordy but helpful way to keep discussion calm.
* If someone is offended by your post, don’t minimize the validity of others’ feelings by cutting them off with an “I didn’t mean it that way.” Rather, apologize, explain what you did mean, and ask how to improve. At the end of the day, be okay with agreeing to disagree. The last word rarely leaves a pleasant taste in the mouth.
* If you are offended by someone’s post, always be kind in explaining why and be constructive when friendly corrections are necessary. If you don’t feel able to respond to an offense in that manner, you can message the moderators and one of them will sort it out for you.
* If you find yourself unable or not wanting to discuss a topic further, you are always allowed to recuse yourself from the situation. If you feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed with responses and want to just walk away, just leave a comment saying so. If someone else has recused themselves, respect their decision and don’t tag them in your comments or pressure them to respond. (However, the decision to delete or end a thread entirely is up to the thread’s creator or the moderators.)
* As a general discussion rule: when you can, please do take the time to educate your fellow hackers, for the betterment of the community. Getting extremely offended over every trivial thing, passive-aggressive sniping, and general unpleasantness is unwelcome; thoughtful, productive discussion is welcome entirely.

#### #2: Be as involved as you want to be.

* This group has thousands of members. This means some are more vocal than others, and new members or quieter members often feel left out. “Lurking” is a totally valid way to belong, and attending gatherings is never required, but know that your participation is one hundred percent welcome, anytime.
* A good way to get involved is to start a thread about something you’re interested in. Chances are, with this many people in the group, someone else is bound to be excited to talk about your favorite library/program/website/language. Jump in!
* Advertising your personal projects is totally allowed, as long as it’s not of a spam-like nature. For example, posting an app or website you made, a club you’re involved with, or a cause you’re fighting for is awesome, creative, and exciting. Bumping it constantly or reposting it daily is inappropriate. If you want to give people work-in-progress updates, check out [HH What Are You Working On?](http://hh.gd/waywo)

#### #3: Keep it cooperative.

* Avoid excessive vulgarity and insults.
* Be open and encouraging. Inside jokes and knee-jerk responses (“LOL PHP”) can be fun in our personal lives, but in large groups, they tend to just leave people out or make them feel bad.
When you post, look for ways to empower the disempowered, break down stereotypes, and otherwise encourage everyone in the Hackathon Hackers community to enjoy hackathons and hacker culture.
* [Include everyone.](#inclusivity-statement) For example, ask about the most influential leaders in tech instead of the most influential guys in tech.
* If you must criticize, keep it constructive. It is far, far easier to tear something down than to build something up, and this is a community all about building. We should encourage people to create as much as possible.

#### #4: Safety comes first.

* For safety reasons, personal information such as phone numbers and emails should not be exchanged publicly. If you wish to exchange information with another member of the group, it should be done privately outside of the group.
* Similarly, don’t post the personal information of other people.
* Some of us have become great friends because of this group, but safety is always a good idea when meeting people from the Internet. Group gatherings and meet-ups should always be in public places, preferably during daylight hours and accessible by public transit. If you create an event for the group, it must not be in someone’s home.

#### #5: Disagreements are private affairs.

* If you have an issue with a member or moderator please take it up with the moderators privately via Facebook message to avoid people ganging up or taking sides in an argument in which they are not directly involved. It’s best to contact the moderators on Facebook via private group message so we can discuss the issue with you. We promise that everything will be confidential and we won’t get mad at you if you have a complaint.

## Inclusivity Statement

**Hackathon Hackers is the all-inclusive hackathons group.**

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.

**Our community prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:**

* 'Reverse'-isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia'
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you"
* Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts
* Communicating in a 'tone' you don’t find congenial
* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Laws of Robotics

There are certain commands moderators can enter as comments to manage threads. Presently these include:

* `/thread` — This is our way of locking threads. From there on out, only moderators can post.
* `/slow` — Only one post per minute per user on the thread is allowed.
* `/ama $AMAer` — Our way of hosting Ask Me Anything's. Only the person doing the AMA will be able post on that thread. A separate thread will exist for questions, keeping the AMA answers tidy.

These commands are implemented through [Hackbot](http://hh.gd/hackbot), an extensible Facebook Group automoderator. We are looking to expand on these in the future.

## FAQs

> What should I do if I see someone violating the Code of Conduct?

There's an option to report a thread if you click on the arrow in its top right hand corner. Then, a mod will look into it and take action. If the problem isn't specific to a thread, reach out to one of the [HH moderators](#moderators) directly.

> Why is this moderator ignoring me?

Moderators are volunteers with busy lives outside of HH. They will usually reply to you very promptly or connect you with someone who can, but if a moderator is taking longer to get back to you than you would like, please be patient. 

> What if I disagree with the moderator who reached out to me?

Feel free to reach out to other moderators, but all mods use the same CoC so I would not expect different results.

> Can I contribute and improve this code of conduct?

Contributions are welcome on how to improve this code of conduct! Send us a pull request with your suggestions.

> Doesn't this impact the right to free speech?

[Nope.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png)
